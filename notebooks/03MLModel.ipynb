    "# MLB Player Trajectory Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook represents the final modeling stage of the MLBPlayerTrajectories project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a longitudinal player–season dataset built in prior notebooks, we focus on\n",
    "predicting how a player’s offensive performance *changes* from one season to the next.\n",
    "Rather than modeling raw outcomes directly, this notebook frames player performance\n",
    "as a **trajectory problem**, identifying breakouts, declines, bouncebacks, and stable\n",
    "profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "All modeling is performed using only information available *before* the prediction\n",
    "season. Underlying process metrics, such as plate discipline and contact quality,\n",
    "are used as features, while outcome metrics are reserved exclusively for labeling\n",
    "and evaluation to prevent information leakage."

    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this notebook is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Construct player-level historical features using prior-season data\n",
    "- Define interpretable trajectory labels based on changes in offensive outcomes\n",
    "- Train and evaluate models that identify breakout and decline risk\n",
    "- Produce player-level predictions suitable for ranking and visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "The final output of this notebook will support both analytical interpretation and\n",
    "downstream visualization in Power BI."

    "## Modeling Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook follows a set of guiding principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Longitudinal perspective**: Players are modeled across multiple seasons rather\n",
    "  than treated as static observations.\n",
    "- **Process over results**: Underlying skill indicators are used as predictive\n",
    "  features, while box-score outcomes are excluded from model inputs.\n",
    "- **Interpretability first**: Models are selected to balance predictive performance\n",
    "  with clear, explainable drivers.\n",
    "- **Reproducibility**: All transformations and assumptions are made explicit and\n",
    "  applied consistently across seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adhering to these principles, the analysis mirrors how performance forecasting\n",
    "is approached in real-world baseball analytics settings."

    "\n",
    "This notebook begins with a cleaned, joined player–season dataset exported from\n",

    "The workflow proceeds through feature construction, trajectory labeling, modeling,\n",
    "and result interpretation, concluding with exportable outputs for visualization\n",
